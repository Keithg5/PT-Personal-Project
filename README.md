# PT-Personal-Project

For the next week you will begin working on a personal project of your choosing that will synthesize the skills you've developed over the last few months. Be prepared to present what you've built to class a week from next Monday.  The purpose of this project is to build and host something that you can use to demonstrate your ability.  Your project can be anything but must follow some guidelines.

## Project Requirements

* Must be a full-stack project.  Must have a back-end application and a client application.
* The client must either be a web or mobile application (You should use React).
* You must use a database (Preferably Mongo).
* Work on making it functional before making it look pretty.
* Other than these points your project can be anything you want it to be.

## Bonus

It will look very good if you can get these pieces included as well.

* Implement an authentication system.
* Add automated tests.
* Add documentation.
* Host your application.
